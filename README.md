TODOS:

- IO
	- better io system. Current one is too one dimentional
	- Input should be interpreted based on context i.e, GAME mode moves the character, DEBUG mode moves only the camera, MENU mode operates on the UI.

- menuing
	- go to new menu loop within main gameloop
	- may depend on implimenting a better IO callback system
